# If no player has sent a correct count in x seconds the broadcaster will send an 'IdleBroadcast'

# By inverting the blacklist you're essentially creating a whitelist i.e. enabled worlds list.
# Use this if you have e.g. 10 worlds and only want to enable The Counting Game in one world.
# Instead of blacklisting 9 worlds you can invert the list and add the only enabled world.
